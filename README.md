Geomem is a simple application written in JavaScript (Vanilla using ES6 
features), HTML and SCSS.

I use this application to set the "I went" locations. You can self host this 
application and use it too ! Nobody can control those data.

## Requirements

* git
* yarn

## Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/yoannfleurydev/geomem && cd geomem`
* `yarn`
* `yarn start`
